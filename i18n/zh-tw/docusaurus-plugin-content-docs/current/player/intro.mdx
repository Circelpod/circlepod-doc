# 玩家類型

## 新手玩家

Just entered the CirclePod family, just learned to support, and obtained a small number of players with a support token. Through this guide, players of this type will gradually shift to the following types of player development.

## Wide-ranged Player

Wide-ranged Players who support various creative types and like to dabble in a field.

## Stan

The concept is similar to stan, and is actively collecting news and trends from the creator. For the creator, how many CPX there is, how much CPX is in support!

## Bandwagon

This type of player does not necessarily have a creator with a specific hobby, but the popular Podcaster must be chased! Looking at the support token in his hand, you can know which creators are the current popular users, which can be called the trend leader in the podcast world!

## Collectible player

He is extremely obsessed with collecting all the support tokens for a few specific programs. The quote is "I must have what others have, and I don’t necessarily have what others have", so cool!

## Sugar Daddy

This type of player always using "a large number of CPX" to support the podcaster. With him, podcasters can freely express their creativity without worrying about difficulties in their livelihoods.

## Casual player

Casual players who do not actively support or are keen to obtain a certificate of support, but often go to the platform to watch various data.

## Integrated player

If you have the above multiple characteristics, you are a comprehensive player. It means that your development in Circlepod is very balanced and hope you have a good time!
