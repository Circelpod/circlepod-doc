## Governance

Governance is a process of democratization. Through this process, the poll of Circlepod Protocol will be voted by the community, and community participants will determine the correct direction of the Protocol they need.

## CPX Token in Governance

CPX can be used as the governance token of Circlepod Protocol, and users who have CPX can vote on Polls. For each poll, users can choose at most the CPX they pledge to vote. Therefore, users with higher CPX will exert greater influence in Polls.

## Polls

The new governance proposal in Circlepod is called Polls, and everyone can create a poll by paying CPX. If the vote fails to pass the minimum number of votes, the CPX deposit will be provided to CPX Stake holders and will be distributed proportionally based on the relative equity.

Polls includes a description of the poll which may further have external links to resources and discussions, including an executable matters. The poll is executed using the Circlepod Gov contract, which has the right to call any content defined by other Circlepod smart contracts.

After submission, the community can vote on it until the end of the voting period. If the quorum is voted through and the conditions are met, the content can be automatically executed at the set time, and these changes can take effect without updating the core of agreement contract.
