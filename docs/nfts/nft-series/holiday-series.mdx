        The sunset gradually fell, the moon outside gradually climbed, and the cool wind blew gently. Lanny, Teddy and Massee are discussing what they are doing at the Orange Holiday Hotel.

"What is Yutu doing on the moon?" Teddy asked curiously while eating the mooncakes that Massee had just baked.

"It's mochi! If it were me, I would pound mochi," Lanny said firmly.

"I remember the story is to make medicine!" Masse thought.

"I vote for the medicine, because if it's mochi, then Massee will make it for us!" Teddy said with a smile.

"Yeah! Thats' really make sense!" Lanny nodded without thinking. And Massee is smiling shyly.

This is the first Mid-Autumn Festival to come to Orange Holiday Hotel. Although Lanny has just arrived in an unfamiliar environment, but with a partner around him, Lanny always feels very at ease in his heart. What interesting things will happen in the days to come?

        In order for the Orange Holiday Hostel to operate smoothly, Teddy suggested that Massee uses his best cooking skills to make desserts, and when they participated in the parade on Halloween, three of them promoted the goods of the Orange Holiday together. So Massee set about preparing ideas for Halloween.

Lanny had put on the magician costume he prepared early, and looked forward to the upcoming Halloween parade. Teddy followed. Massee hopes everyone can enjoy the Halloween atmosphere together, so he made a lot of finger biscuits, and wrote the Instagram of Orange Holiday Hostel with chocolate on the fingers, and shared them with the people who participated in the parade.

Parade time and biscuits disappeared quickly, and Massee thoughtfully reserved a snack for both Lanny and Teddy.

"It's so delicious!" Teddy couldn't help but admire. "Where did you learn your cooking skills?"

Can't wait for Massee's response. Suddenly, a child ran over panting. "Pumpkin jam (referring to Massee dressed up as a pumpkin), are there biscuits?" The child looked at Massee expectantly.

Massee looked at the empty basket, frowned in distress, and was about to turn down the kid. Suddenly Lanny said to the kid, "Hey! Let the magician make one for you!"

"Show me magic! The cookies come out!" Lanny put the last finger biscuit in his hand and reached out to the child.

Seeing the children eating with relish, the three of them couldn't help feeling happy.

It was Halloween in 2021. Although the weather is very cold, the warm atmosphere still surrounds these four people.

        A lazy morning.

"It's snowing!" Teddy was the first person to discover the winter coming, turning her head happily to signal to everyone.

"Then let's make a snowman!" Lanny and Massee were very excited!

Neither of them have seen snow before, and are looking forward to trying the snowman mentioned in the story!

Lanny tried to imagine the scenes he had seen in the animation, constantly focusing the snow in one place, but he couldn't make these snow flakes into snowballs.

Massee is looking for a stone, hoping that snow can attach to the stone and turn into a snowball.

I saw Teddy walk out leisurely with a little water and a scarf from the house, and picked up some dead branches. With some water on his hands, he first made the snow flakes into a small ball, and began to use the surrounding snow to roll into a big snowball.

The two watched dumbfoundedly at Teddy rolling a small snowball into a big snowball.

"Sure enough, it's a girl from Boomerang!"

Lanny and Massee can't wait to make snowballs, and the three of them work together to complete the snowman.

        On the morning of Christmas Eve, Lanny and his party came to the Christmas market, looking for ornaments to decorate the Christmas party.

The Christmas market in Parelis City is one of the best in the universe. It is open from mid-November to the end of each year. The market has a wide range of goods. The talking nutcracker robot, the matches of the little match girl, or the oversized Christmas tree, it seems that this is a Christmas city, and Christmas is all year round.

"Candy canes are a must!" Masse saw the vendor selling Christmas candy at a glance, and began to stir up candy canes of all kinds, imagining them hanging on the Christmas tree.

"I want to buy a gift box!" This year's Christmas party event was to exchange gifts. Teddy chose a gift box as the theme of the event.

"Lanny! There's an elk's nose here!" Teddy said to Lanny in a tone that he had discovered something new and strange, and put his nose on Lanny's.

"Very suitable!" Teddy said happily. Lanny looked at himself in the mirror and compared the horns of an elk on his head.

"Super cute!" Teddy pulled Lanny dressed up as an elk to the counter to check out.

Walking along the road and watching, the three of them all picked their own style Christmas hats and bought all the items needed for Christmas. The three of them returned home in large and small bags, ready to set up their Christmas party tomorrow night!

        On the evening of Christmas Eve, the Orange Holiday Hotel held a Christmas party, and everyone had a happy dinner together.

While everyone was enjoying dinner, Lanny and Teddy put numbers on all the gifts and put the numbered lottery tickets into the lottery box.

After eating and drinking, Lanny walked to the small table and announced the beginning of the gift exchange session.

"Has everyone eaten? Let's start the lucky draw for exchanging gifts!"

Those present nodded, and Lanny went on to explain, "Thank you Massee for preparing so many delicious foods for everyone today! Let's give him a round of applause!" The audience clapped their hands and even cheered!

"Massee is here to draw the first gift. We have already numbered all the gifts. After the owner who is drawn to the gift comes to the stage and gives the gift to Masse, he can come to draw his own gift! So everyone has What's the problem?"

"No!" everyone said in unison.

The event went smoothly, but Massee also found that there were some people who had no gifts to exchange. Massee hurried to the kitchen to make his best biscuits, and found Teddy, who was very skilled, to pack the biscuits. Before the event ended, Masse ran to the stage and whispered to Lanny.

"Tonight is very happy! I hope everyone who participates in the exchange of gifts can have gifts that you like! It doesn't matter if you don't participate. Masse made a lot of cookies for everyone as Christmas gifts! Remember to go to the door and get a bag before you go home. Cookies! Happy Christmas to everyone!" Cheers resounded throughout the Orange Holiday Hotel!
