        The sunset gradually fell, the moon outside gradually climbed, and the cool wind blew gently. Lanny, Teddy and Massee are discussing what they are doing at the Orange Holiday Hotel.

"What is Yutu doing on the moon?" Teddy asked curiously while eating the mooncakes that Massee had just baked.

"It's mochi! If it were me, I would pound mochi," Lanny said firmly.

"I remember the story is to make medicine!" Masse thought.

"I vote for the medicine, because if it's mochi, then Massee will make it for us!" Teddy said with a smile.

"Yeah! Thats' really make sense!" Lanny nodded without thinking. And Massee is smiling shyly.

This is the first Mid-Autumn Festival to come to Orange Holiday Hotel. Although Lanny has just arrived in an unfamiliar environment, but with a partner around him, Lanny always feels very at ease in his heart. What interesting things will happen in the days to come?
