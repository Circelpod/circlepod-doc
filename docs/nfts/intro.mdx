        The sunset gradually set, the moon outside gradually climbed, the cool wind blew gently, blowing away the heat in the house, and the smell of autumn came quietly. Lanny, Teddy and Massee are discussing what they are doing in the Orange Holiday Hotel.

Lanny: "Wow! T look! The moon is so round!" Lanny patted Teddy's shoulder with excitement with one hand, and with the other hand, he was restlessly trying to point at the unpointable target.

Teddy: "Hehe! That's right!" Teddy raised Lanny's hand up naughty, and Lanny hurriedly hid his hand behind his back.

Massee said, "Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival!" Massee said happily. M slowly took out a box of moon cakes from the refrigerator and said enthusiastically: "I have prepared a lot of moon cakes for everyone!".

Lanny: "That's great! I like mooncakes so much! Especially the one with egg yolk!" Lanny looked in Massee's direction with excitement.

Teddy: "It's your favorite!" Teddy stared at the mooncake on Massee's hand without hiding his eyes. Lanny drooled, showing a headache.

Lanny took a sip of water, "Yeah! Otherwise, how could I have my own gourmet Instagram!".

Lanny and Teddy talked about each other, Massee carefully arranged the mooncakes, and Lanny took out the phone to take a picture, and skillfully uploaded the picture layout to the channel run by him.

Lanny: "Come, come, come~" The trio who had already had a tacit understanding each took a piece of mooncake and faced the lens of Lanny to take pictures. three! two! one! Click!

Lanny: "Look if it works~"

Teddy and Massee both said in unison: "Yes!"

"Login Leng!", you have been marked as a limited-time activity.

Teddy: "It's too fast!"

Massee: "Okay, well, come and taste it!".

This is the first Mid-Autumn Festival to come to Orange Holiday Hotel. Although he has just arrived in an unfamiliar environment, but with a partner around him, Lanny always feels very at ease in his heart. What interesting things will happen in the days to come?
