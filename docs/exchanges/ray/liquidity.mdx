        The sunset gradually fell, the moon outside gradually climbed, and the cool wind blew gently. Lanny, Teddy and Massee are discussing what they are doing at the Orange Holiday Hotel.

"What is Yutu doing on the moon?" Teddy asked curiously while eating the mooncakes that Massee had just baked.

"It's mochi! If it were me, I would pound mochi," Lanny said firmly.

"I remember the story is to make medicine!" Masse thought.

"I vote for the medicine, because if it's mochi, then Massee will make it for us!" Teddy said with a smile.

"Yeah! Thats' really make sense!" Lanny nodded without thinking. And Massee is smiling shyly.

This is the first Mid-Autumn Festival to come to Orange Holiday Hotel. Although Lanny has just arrived in an unfamiliar environment, but with a partner around him, Lanny always feels very at ease in his heart. What interesting things will happen in the days to come?

        In order for the Orange Holiday Hostel to operate smoothly, Teddy suggested that Massee uses his best cooking skills to make desserts, and when they participated in the parade on Halloween, three of them promoted the goods of the Orange Holiday together. So Massee set about preparing ideas for Halloween.

Lanny had put on the magician costume he prepared early, and looked forward to the upcoming Halloween parade. Teddy followed. Massee hopes everyone can enjoy the Halloween atmosphere together, so he made a lot of finger biscuits, and wrote the Instagram of Orange Holiday Hostel with chocolate on the fingers, and shared them with the people who participated in the parade.

Parade time and biscuits disappeared quickly, and Massee thoughtfully reserved a snack for both Lanny and Teddy.

"It's so delicious!" Teddy couldn't help but admire. "Where did you learn your cooking skills?"

Can't wait for Massee's response. Suddenly, a child ran over panting. "Pumpkin jam (referring to Massee dressed up as a pumpkin), are there biscuits?" The child looked at Massee expectantly.

Massee looked at the empty basket, frowned in distress, and was about to turn down the kid. Suddenly Lanny said to the kid, "Hey! Let the magician make one for you!"

"Show me magic! The cookies come out!" Lanny put the last finger biscuit in his hand and reached out to the child.

Seeing the children eating with relish, the three of them couldn't help feeling happy.

It was Halloween in 2021. Although the weather is very cold, the warm atmosphere still surrounds these four people.
