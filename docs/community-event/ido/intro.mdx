[**Now, Go to IDO Page**](https://ido.circlepod.app)

To the Circlepod community,

First of all, thanks to the community partners who have always supported Circlepod. After community events and hackathons, the Circlepod has become more and more perfect:

## Wen CPX?

![wen.gif](/img/ido/wen.gif)

Many people are looking forward to when to release CPX and are very happy to receive a lot of encouragement from the community. These have made the Circlepod community more active and stronger, and we also think that now is the best time to release CPX. The rules are as follows:

## Description

During this period, we have referred to many IDO projects using **Mango Markets contracts**. 
We must emphasize that tokens that will be circulated after IDO 
will be used at liquidity and marketing tokens strictly enforced, 
as stated in the [Tokenomics](/docs/Tokenomics/intro)

When we hold IDO, we strictly consider the following points: 

- Everyone can participate in IDO
- No **private sale and pre-sale**
- Appropriate circulation to maintain the health of tokens
- Provide centralized and decentralized exchange circulation.

You can check on the [blockchain browser](https://solscan.io/token/CPXDs2uhNwDKAt9V3vXvtspv9U7rsQ2fVr1qAUDmuCaq) that the Token supply is not circulating to any wallet.

On this basis, we added restrictions on the withdrawal of USDC, which increased the cost of withdrawal of USDC. 
We hope that through this mechanism, the problem of IDO prices being too untrue during the sale period can be reduced.

## Community Sales Rules

- Token form: Solana Fungible Token

## Stages

### The first stage, sales period (48H)

Within 48 hours of **Sale Period**, you can deposit or withdraw USDC to the smart contract vault.

At this stage, you can deposit or withdraw USDC freely.

### The second stage, grace period (24H)

The 24 hours after the first phase is **Grace Period**. If you think the token price is too high, you can safely withdraw USDC. 
At the same time, during this period, you can no longer deposit any USDC, and the price of $CPX can only fall at this stage.
