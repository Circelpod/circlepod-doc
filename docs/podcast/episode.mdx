## What is episode?

Episode represents each episode under the channel, and each channel can have multiple episodes. 
The episode belongs to a non-fungible token (NFT).
With metadata, conform to [ERC-1155 JSON Schema](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema ) Format.

:::tip
Although NFT Meta data conforms to [ERC-1155 JSON Schema](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema), it meets the cross-chain conditions, but the current Circlepod Protocol is mainly on **Solana**.

## Royalty of paid episode 

Every Podcaster can pay CPX to create a episode. Podcaster can set up paid content for the episode. 
Even if there are partners on the episode, you can easily mark each collaborator. And set the percentage of profit sharing. 
Every time a listener or user purchases the right to listen to a single episode, these profit distributions will be directly and automatically sent to the rules you set.

:::tip
The current agreement charges a 0.3% agreement fee for each profit distribution. These fees will be returned to the program's rewards. Of course, the tax rate can be adjusted through [governance](/docs/governance/intro).
